# LanguageTool

> [LanguageTool](https://www.languagetool.org/) is an Open Source proofreading software for English, French, German, Polish, Russian, and [more than 20 other languages](https://languagetool.org/languages/). It finds many errors that a simple spell checker cannot detect.

The source repository can be found [here](https://github.com/miurahr/docker-languagetool).

About this image:

- It uses the private [fork source](https://github.com/miurahr/languagetool/tree/omegat-6.5)
- It builds a container image from the source.
- It uses a patched version of languagetool 6.5 snapshot with Lucene 8.11.3.
- It uses the OpenJDK Java 21 slim base image
- includes `fasttext`
- It uses `gosu`
  - container starts as root and executes languagetool as restricted user using `exec gosu`
  - container fixes folder ownership for ngrams and fasttext folders
- Entrypoint uses `tini` to suppress the container exiting with status code 143 (LanguageTool does not handle SIGTERM as it should)
- optional: download ngram language modules if configured (when there have never been downloaded yet.)
  - It uses the ngram module upgraded to Lucene 8 format 
- optional: download fasttext module (if it doesn't already exist)
- optional: user mapping (make sure to check MAP_UID and MAP_GID below)
- optional: set log level

An example compose file can be downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miurahr/docker-languagetool/main/compose.yml).

## Compose execution

You can use containerd's `nerdctl`, rancher desktop or `docker` CLI command.

```console
git clone https://github.com/miurahr/docker-languagetool.git
cd docker-languagetool
nerdctl compose build
nerdctl compose up
```

## Parameters

The environment parameters are split into two halves, separated by an equal, the left-hand side represents the variable names (use them as is) the right-hand side the value (change if necessary).

| ENV| DEFAULT | DESCRIPTION |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| download_ngrams_for_langs | none | Optional: Comma separated list of languages to download ngrams for. Skips download if the ngrams for that language already exist. Valid languages: `en`, `de`, `es`, `fr` and `nl`. Example value: `en,de` |
| langtool_languageModel | /ngrams | Optional: The base path to the ngrams models. |
| langtool_fasttextBinary | /usr/local/bin/fasttext | Optional: Path to the fasttext binary. Change only if you want to test your own compiled binary. Don't forget to map it into the container as volume. |
| langtool_fasttextModel |  | Optional: The container path to the fasttext model binary. If the variable is set, the fasttext model will be downloaded if doesn't exist yet. |
| langtool_*|  |  Optional: An arbitrary languagetool configuration, consisting of the prefix `langtool_` and the key name as written in the config file. Execute `docker run -ti --rm meyay/languagetool help` to see the list of config options |
| JAVA_XMS | 256m | Optional: Minimum size of the Java heap space. Valid suffixes are `m` for megabytes and `g` for gigabytes.|
| JAVA_XMX | 1024m | Optional: Maximum size of the Java heap space. Valid suffixes are `m` for megabytes and `g` for gigabytes. Set a higher value if you experience OOM kills, but do not use more than 1/4 of the host memory! |
| JAVA_GC | SerialGC | Optional: Configure the garbage collector the JVM will use. Valid options are: `SerialGC`, `ParallelGC`, `ParNewGC`, `G1GC`, `ZGC` |
| JAVA_OPTS | | Optional: Set you own custom Java options for the JVM. This will render the other JAVA_* options useless. |
| MAP_UID | 783 | Optional: UID of the user inside the container that runs LanguageTool. If you encounter permission problems with your volumes, make sure to set the parameter to the UID of the host folder owner. |
| MAP_GID | 783 | Optional: GID of the user inside the container that runs LanguageTool. If you encounter permission problems with your volumes, make sure to set the parameter to the GID of the host folder owner. |
| LOG_LEVEL| INFO | Optional: set log level for LanguageTool. Valid options are: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`. |

## Fasttext support

Now that fasttext is available since Alpine 3.19, the image switched to using the Alpine package, instead of compiling the binaries from the sources. This hopefully fixes the compatibility issue users with older cpus experienced with my previous images, that were build on a amd64v3 architecture cpu, which compiled the `fasttext` binary with cpu optimizations older cpus do not support.

If the debian `fasttext` package does not work for you, you can build a custom image to compile the `fasttext` binary using cpu optimizations your cpu (as long as it's x86_64 based) actually understands:

```
git clone https://github.com/miurahr/docker-languagetool.git
cd docker-languagetool
nerdctl build -t miurahr/languagetool:latest -f Dockerfile.fasttext .
```

Once the image is build, you can `nerdctl compose up -d`.

>NOTE1: Synology users can find a git package in the [SynoCommunity](https://synocommunity.com) repository.
